Given one number, 20, expected to return error.
Given two strings, "foo" anI wd "bar", expected to return error.

concatOdds
The function will take two arrays of integers and return a single
array of integers with only unique odd numbers from both arrays in order of ascension.

Given two arrays of integers:
[2, 0, 9, 6, 9, 1], [8, 9, 6, 5, 4, 2]
expected result:
[1, 5, 9]
Given two arrays of integers:
[6, 10, 11, 7, 10, 5, 3, 12], [3, 5, 4, 0, 1, 2, 14, 10]
expected result:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
Given two arrays of chars:
[s,i,x,t,w,o,f,i,v,e], [t,w,e,n,t,y,-,t,h,r,e,e]
expected result error.
Given two strings:
"1,5,4,8", "7,5,9,9"
expected result:
[1,5,7,9]
